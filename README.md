Send to Stache is a really simple AppleScript (served through an Automator Service) that lets you save articles to [Stache](http://getstache.com) from [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/). 

Once you’ve installed the service, if you want to activate it via a keyboard shortcut, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts and add a shortcut for Reeder with the Menu Title “Send to Stache” and the keyboard shortcut of your choice.

Enjoy!
